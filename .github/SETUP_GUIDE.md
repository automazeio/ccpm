# GitHub Actions Setup Guide for CCPM

This guide walks through setting up the GitHub Actions workflows and branch protection for the CCPM project.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Repository Setup
The workflows are now configured in your repository. After pushing these changes, you'll have:

- **Cross-Platform CI** (`ci.yml`) - Full testing on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- **Quick Status Check** (`status-check.yml`) - Fast validation for PRs  
- **Release Testing** (`release-test.yml`) - Comprehensive release validation

### 2. Enable Workflows
1. Push the `.github/` directory to your repository
2. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
3. Workflows will be automatically enabled

### 3. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

#### Navigate to Branch Protection Settings
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches** in your repository
2. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for `main`/`master`

#### Configure Required Status Checks
Enable these required status checks:
```
‚úÖ Quick Status Check
‚úÖ Test on Ubuntu Latest  
‚úÖ Test on macOS Latest
‚úÖ Test on Windows Latest
```

#### Recommended Protection Rules
```yaml
Branch name pattern: main
Settings:
  ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals (1 minimum recommended)
  ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed  
  ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
  ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
```

## üîß Workflow Features

### Manual Trigger Options
You can manually run the CI workflow with custom options:

1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Cross-Platform CI**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Choose options:
   - **Test Suite:** `all`, `test-only`, `install-only`
   - **Debug Mode:** Enable for detailed logs

### What Each Workflow Does

#### `ci.yml` - Cross-Platform CI
- **Runs on:** PR creation/updates, pushes to main, manual dispatch
- **Tests:** Full Makefile test suite on all platforms
- **Features:**
  - Smart change detection (skips tests for doc-only changes)
  - Install script validation  
  - Automatic PR status comments
  - Test artifact uploads
  - Debug mode support

#### `status-check.yml` - Quick Status Check
- **Runs on:** PR creation/updates, pushes to main  
- **Tests:** Fast validation checks
- **Features:**
  - File existence validation
  - Makefile syntax checking
  - Shell script syntax validation
  - Portable shebang verification

#### `release-test.yml` - Release Testing  
- **Runs on:** Release creation, version tags, manual dispatch
- **Tests:** Comprehensive release validation
- **Features:**
  - Full test suite execution
  - Installation process validation
  - Release quality reports

## üß™ Testing the Setup

### Local Testing
Before creating PRs, test locally:
```bash
# Run the same tests as CI
make test

# Check system compatibility
make check-system  

# Validate PM system
make validate

# Test install scripts (simulation)
make info
```

### Testing Workflows
1. **Create a test branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-ci-setup
   echo "# Test change" >> README.md
   git add . && git commit -m "test: trigger CI"
   git push origin test-ci-setup
   ```

2. **Create a PR** to trigger the workflows

3. **Check Results** in the Actions tab

## üìä Understanding Workflow Results

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks next to commit/PR
- Automatic PR comment with success message
- All required status checks passing

### Failure Troubleshooting
- ‚ùå Red X indicates failure
- Click on failed check for detailed logs
- Download artifacts for test logs
- Use manual dispatch with debug enabled

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Windows-Specific Issues
```yaml
Issue: Make command not found
Solution: Workflow automatically installs make via chocolatey

Issue: PowerShell vs CMD differences  
Solution: Workflow uses PowerShell (pwsh) consistently
```

#### macOS-Specific Issues
```yaml
Issue: Permission denied on scripts
Solution: Workflow automatically makes scripts executable

Issue: Missing Xcode tools
Solution: GitHub macOS runners include required tools
```

#### Ubuntu-Specific Issues
```yaml
Issue: Missing dependencies
Solution: Workflow installs Python and required tools

Issue: File permissions
Solution: Scripts made executable in workflow
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Workflow Permissions
- Workflows run with minimal required permissions
- No repository secrets exposed in logs  
- Temporary directories used for testing

### Safe Manual Dispatch
- Manual triggers require repository access
- Debug mode only shows sanitized information
- No sensitive data in workflow outputs

## üìà Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Update runner versions** quarterly
2. **Review workflow efficiency** monthly
3. **Check artifact storage usage** as needed
4. **Update status check requirements** when adding features

### Performance Optimization
- Use caching for dependencies if build times increase
- Adjust matrix strategy based on actual usage
- Monitor artifact storage and adjust retention

### Workflow Updates
When updating workflows:
1. Test in a fork first
2. Use manual dispatch for validation
3. Update documentation  
4. Verify branch protection still works

## üéØ Next Steps

### For Development Teams
1. **Train team members** on PR workflow
2. **Set up code review process**  
3. **Configure notifications** for workflow failures
4. **Establish merge policies**

### For Repository Maintainers  
1. **Monitor workflow usage** and costs
2. **Review and update** protection rules as needed
3. **Keep workflows** updated with latest actions
4. **Document any custom** setup requirements

## üìû Support

### Debugging Resources
- **Workflow logs:** Actions tab ‚Üí failed workflow ‚Üí job details
- **Local reproduction:** Use identical `make` commands locally
- **Community help:** GitHub Actions community forums

### Common Commands for Troubleshooting
```bash
# Reproduce CI locally
make check-system
make test

# Debug specific components
make test-pm
make pm-help

# Clean and retry
make clean-all
make test
```

This setup ensures your CCPM project maintains high quality across all supported platforms while providing a smooth development experience for contributors! üöÄ
