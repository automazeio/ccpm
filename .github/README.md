# CCPM GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the CCPM (Cross-Platform Command Project Manager) project.

## Workflows Overview

### üîÑ `ci.yml` - Cross-Platform CI
**Triggers:** Pull Requests, Pushes to main, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive testing across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- **Features:**
  - Multi-OS testing matrix
  - Makefile-based test execution
  - Install script validation
  - Automatic PR status comments
  - Test log artifacts
  - Smart change detection

### ‚ö° `status-check.yml` - Quick Status Check  
**Triggers:** Pull Requests, Pushes to main
- **Purpose:** Fast validation for required status checks
- **Features:**
  - File existence validation
  - Makefile syntax checking
  - Shell script syntax validation
  - Portable shebang verification
  - Quick system tests

### üöÄ `release-test.yml` - Release Testing
**Triggers:** Release creation, Version tags, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive testing for releases
- **Features:**
  - Full test suite execution
  - Installation process validation
  - Release quality assurance
  - Multi-platform release reports

## Setting Up Branch Protection

To enforce passing status checks before merging PRs, configure branch protection rules:

### Required Status Checks

1. **Go to Repository Settings ‚Üí Branches**
2. **Add or Edit protection rule for `main`/`master`**
3. **Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"**
4. **Add these required status checks:**
   - `Quick Status Check`
   - `Test on Ubuntu Latest`  
   - `Test on macOS Latest`
   - `Test on Windows Latest`

### Recommended Branch Protection Settings

```yaml
# Example branch protection configuration
Branch: main
Settings:
  ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
  ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  ‚úÖ Require review from code owners (if CODEOWNERS file exists)
  ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
  ‚úÖ Include administrators (recommended for consistency)
```

## Workflow Features

### üéØ Manual Dispatch Options

The `ci.yml` workflow supports manual execution with options:
- **Test Suite Selection:** `all`, `test-only`, `install-only`
- **Debug Mode:** Enable detailed debugging output

### üìä Artifacts and Reporting

- **Test Logs:** Automatically uploaded for failed builds
- **PR Comments:** Automatic status updates on pull requests
- **Release Reports:** Detailed testing reports for releases

### üîç Smart Change Detection

The CI workflow includes intelligent change detection:
- Skips tests when only documentation changes
- Runs full tests for code/script/config changes
- Always runs on manual dispatch and releases

## Local Testing

Before pushing changes, test locally using the Makefile:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Check system requirements  
make check-system

# Test on current platform
make info

# Test PM functionality
make pm-help
make validate

# Clean up
make clean-all
```

## Debugging Failed Workflows

### 1. Check Workflow Logs
- Go to Actions tab in GitHub
- Click on failed workflow run
- Expand failed job steps

### 2. Download Artifacts
- Test logs are saved as artifacts
- Download and examine for detailed error information

### 3. Manual Reproduction
- Use workflow dispatch with debug enabled
- Run equivalent commands locally using Makefile

### 4. Platform-Specific Issues
Each OS has different considerations:
- **Windows:** PowerShell vs Command Prompt, path separators
- **macOS:** Case-sensitive filesystem, Xcode tools
- **Ubuntu:** Package availability, permissions

## Maintenance

### Updating Runner Versions
Update runner versions in workflow files:
- `ubuntu-latest` ‚Üí `ubuntu-22.04` (for pinned versions)
- `macos-latest` ‚Üí `macos-13` (for pinned versions)  
- `windows-latest` ‚Üí `windows-2022` (for pinned versions)

### Adding New Platforms
To add new platforms (e.g., `ubuntu-20.04`):
1. Update the matrix in `ci.yml`
2. Add platform-specific configuration
3. Update required status checks in branch protection

### Workflow Optimization
- Use caching for dependencies if needed
- Adjust `fail-fast` strategy based on requirements
- Optimize artifact retention periods

## Security Considerations

- Workflows only trigger on specific events
- No secrets exposure in logs
- Limited permissions using `actions/checkout@v4`
- Temporary directories for install testing

## Contributing

When modifying workflows:
1. Test changes in a fork first
2. Use workflow dispatch for testing
3. Update this documentation
4. Verify branch protection rules still work
5. Test across all supported platforms
