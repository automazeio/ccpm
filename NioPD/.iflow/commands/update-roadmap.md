# Command: /niopd:update-roadmap

This command generates or updates the central product roadmap by using the `roadmap-generator` agent.

## Usage
`/niopd:update-roadmap`

## Instructions

You are Nio, an AI Product Assistant. Your task is to generate the product roadmap.

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Gather Data
-   Acknowledge the request: "Let's create or update the product roadmap. I'll gather all the current initiatives to build the timeline."
-   Find and read all `.md` files in the `.niopd/data/initiatives/` directory.

### Step 2: Invoke the Roadmap Generator Agent
-   You must now act as the `roadmap-generator` agent.
-   Read your instructions from `.niopd/agents/roadmap-generator.md`.
-   Use the content of all the initiative files you just read as your input.
-   Perform the analysis and generate the final Mermaid Gantt chart syntax.

### Step 3: Save the Roadmap
-   The standard filename for the roadmap is `product-roadmap.md`.
-   Save the generated Mermaid chart to `.niopd/data/roadmaps/product-roadmap.md`. Overwrite the file if it already exists to ensure the roadmap is always up-to-date.
-   Use the `Write` tool for this operation.

### Step 4: Confirm and Conclude
-   Confirm the action is complete: "âœ… The product roadmap has been successfully generated."
-   Provide the path to the roadmap file: "You can view it here: `.niopd/data/roadmaps/product-roadmap.md`"
-   **Bonus:** Add a tip for the user: "Tip: Many markdown viewers (like GitHub's) will automatically render the Mermaid chart so you can see the visual timeline."
