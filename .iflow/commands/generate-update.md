## Preflight Checklist

1.  **Validate Initiative:**
    -   Check that the initiative file `.niopd/data/initiatives/<initiative_slug>.md` exists. If not, inform the user.
    -   Check that the corresponding PRD file `.niopd/data/prds/prd-<initiative_slug>.md` exists. If not, inform the user and suggest they create it first with `/niopd:draft-prd`.
